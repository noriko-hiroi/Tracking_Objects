# Tracking_Objects
This is the repository for the code of object tracking based on Transformer.
All code and data were prepared by Koya Takahashi(mskey17).

##### How to use trCOMITformer #####
1. Prepare your csv
   The csv data must consists of the column of 
ID, time[msec], X, Y, Velocity[nm/sec], angle[degree], normpix[Âµm^2], Distance

Among above, normpix and Distance is not needed to be a true values (it will not affect the results), but you need to input them even just a dummy set.

2. Run csv2pkl_comet.py at the place you store the above csv.
You musty modify the file mane to your data csv.
You have to check and rewrite the L21 ~ L23 dependent on your environment(the path and the filename).

Then you will get 3 .pkl files(comet_num_time_test.pkl, comet_num_time_train.pkl, comet_num_time_valid.pkl).

4. Now you have to change config_trCOMITformer.py 
 1) L30 ~ L39 dependent on your data characteristics.
For example, if your dataset is small, the number at L30, L31 may be better keeping small number, the other case is oposit.

 2) You have to prepare 3 folders for 3 .pkl files with the name of the .pkl files.

 3) L41 and L43 should have the same file name.

 4) L47 and L48 should have Lon_(Max-Min)(=X), Lat_(Max-Min)(=Y).

 5) L58 ~ L61 should have Lon_Max and Lon_Min(=X), Lat_Max and Lat_Min)(=Y).

 6) L84 requires the folder name of which is the place for the folders of each pkl file.

Now Run config_trCOMITformer.py.

5. Run trCOMITformer.py.
